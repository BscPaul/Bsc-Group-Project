## Movement 
The virtual tour supports 3 modes of movment these are the [[#AWSD Keys]], [[#Mouse controls]] and [[#Virtual reality controls]].

#### Mouse controls
Mouse controls can be used to move the camera and interact with objects in the tour. To use mouse controls, you click inside of the scene and drag the mouse to change the camera position. Interacting with objects in the scene requires you to move the small ring in the centre of the screen on top of an element that is clickable and off again to activate it.

#### AWSD Keys
To make user movement easier the use of AWSD has been added to allow for a form of simple navigation through the scene. AWSD has been configured in the tour to use the "W" key for forward movement and the "S" key for moving backward. These same keys are binded to the arrow keys "UP" and "down" on the keyboard.
``Note: AWSD cannot be used to interact with objects.``


#### Virtual reality controls
Virtual reality controllers are supported in the tour. To utilize VR controls the tour must run it with a valid SSL certificate, see the [[Admin Guide]].
