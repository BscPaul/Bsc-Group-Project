
### Equipment required:
	Monopod (six-foot)
	360 Camera OR 360-degree rotating camera platform / panohead
	Drone
	Editing software & Image Stitcher
	Virtual reality headset

### Main features required in software:
- 360 panoramas can be link together with something called animated hotpoints using a software of our choice.
- Information points can be added to display additional information when clicked depending on the software we decide on.

### Camera settings for quality improvement on shoots:
- HDR allows us to take the same image at different exposures and then blend them together to produce one image that features the best exposed parts from each of the images. [source](https://www.picturecorrect.com/using-hdr-photography-for-panoramas-360-virtual-tours/)
- RAW - Importing the raw image into the editing software will prevent any loss in quality.

### Editing software (several options):
The most likely option would be premiere pro or VeeR since they support various VR headsets. However the more costly options are more professional and will produce a better product, but will be budget dependant.
