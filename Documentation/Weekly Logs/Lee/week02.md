## <strong>Research Agile vs Waterfall</strong>
Completed: **23/09/2022**  

### Agile Pro's | Con's

<details>
<strong>Pro's</strong></br>
<ul>
    <li>Flexibility to respond to the market and new intelligence</li>
    <li>The implementation team has room for creative problem solving</li>
    <li>Self-organizing teams and resource allocation</li>
    <li>Frequent updates and increased customer value</li>
    <li>Rigid cadence, deadline flexibility</li>
</ul></br>
<strong>Con's</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Loose planning can lead to unpredictable finished product and date slippage</li>
    <li>Susceptible to a lack of focus and knee-jerk reactions from Sprint to Sprint</li>
    <li>Relentless pace</li>
    <li>Loose testing requirements may let bugs through</li>
    <li>No opportunities to make changes during a Sprint</li>
</ul>
</details>
</br>

### Waterfall Pro's | Con's

<details>
<strong>Pro's</strong></br>
<ul>
    <li>Minimal scope creep</li>
    <li>A predictable and well-specified final product</li>
    <li>Well-defined roles and responsibilities</li>
    <li>Infrequent releases that can be carefully rolled out and messaged to users and the market</li>
    <li>Precise project plans and firm deadlines</li>
</ul></br>
<strong>Con's</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Lack of flexibility after a specification</li>
    <li>Fewer opportunities to course correct</li>
    <li>Too many gaps between innovations reaching the market</li>
    <li>Too long until bugs are discovered since testing doesnâ€™t occur until the large project is complete</li>
    <li>Beaurocratic change management process</li>
</ul>
</details>
</br>

|IT and Software projects|Long-term projects|
|Enables chnage more easily on projects|Change has to be managed and controlled|

|Delivering in sprints, supports nimble product teams|Delivering by tasks in succession creates task and team dependencies|
