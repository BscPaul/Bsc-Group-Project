**Shetland Dialect Translator Reasearch**
- Currently, shetland ForWirds has an online dictionary that takes Shetland words and tells you what they mean in English.
- Translation Services USA has a translator from most languages to "Shetland(ic)", but when I tried to use it, it kept taking me to a quote page. So I think this translator is something you have to pay for, which is something we should not look to do.
- I don't believe there are many Shetland Dialect rules that are different from English - I think we can do literal translations instead of having to worry about how we would need to change x sentence to make sence in Shetland Dialect.
- Creating a translator would just be a literal translation of the English word to Shetland Dialect, unless we incorporate other languages. This can be achieved by having an English word in a database paired along with it's Shetland Dialect counterpart.
- A website frontend would be best. We can make an app, but that would only be necessary to create depth as currently this project idea lacks depth.
- We can possibly pitch this idea when we have made it to the likes of Shetland ForWirds or Shetland.org.
